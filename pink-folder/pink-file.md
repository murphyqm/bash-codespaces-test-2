# This is a markdown file!

Markdown is a way of formatting plain text files. If you've every used *WhatsApp*, you might have already used some Markdown: WhatsApp uses markdown for italics and bold text, using asterisks (`*`) and underscores (`_`) around text to apply these styles.

Markdown also allows you to use different levels of headers (H1, H2 etc., like in html or in Microsoft Word) which can make your files easier to read.

You can preview markdown files using vscode.
